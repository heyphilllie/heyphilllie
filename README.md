# Hi there! I'm Philly, front end developer and UI designer focusing on building modern, resilient, and inclusive user interfaces.

I have a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Social Science and currently doing a part-time Master's Degree in Computer Sciences. I am merging the best of both worlds to build interactive web applications with a user- / human-centered approach. 

Currently I'm working with the e-commerce team at Germany's market leader for baby articles to redesign the online shop. But with design, development and everything web being what I love to do the most (and what I'm good at) I'm also available for project work. So hit me up if you need help with UX design, UI design and front end development. ‚úåÔ∏è
