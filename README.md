# Hi there! I'm Philly, front end developer and UI designer helping brands build modern, resilient, and inclusive user interfaces.

I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Social Science and currently doing a part-time Master's Degree in Computer Sciences. I am merging the best of both worlds to build interactive web applications - with a user- / human-centered apporach. 

With design, development and everything web being what I love to do the most (and what I'm good at) I'm specializing in responsive web development, modern CSS, progressive enhancement, and accessibility.

I am currently working with the e-commerce team at the german market leader for baby articles.
