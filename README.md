# Hi there! I'm Philly, front end developer and UI designer helping brands build modern, resilient, and inclusive user interfaces.

I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Social Science and doing a part-time Master's Degree ind Computer Sciences; but everything I know of and on the Web today is self-taught. With Design, development and everything web being what I love to do the most (and what I'm good at) I'm specializing in responsive web design, modern CSS, progressive enhancement, and accessibility.

I am currently working with the e-commerce team at the german market leader for baby articles.
